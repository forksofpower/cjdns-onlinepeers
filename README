To run cjdns-onlinepeers, ensure:
	The variables at the top of the script are set correctly
	That cjdcmd can be run from $PATH
	That cjdcmd has been configured to access the admin server by setting up ~/.cjdnsadmin

A typcical ~/.cjdnsadmin file uses the values from your config and looks something like:
{
    "addr": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 11234,
    "password": "yourpassword"
}

You may then simply run 'sh cjdns-onlinepeers' to list the pubkey + ipv6 of the peers in your config and their online status
