CJDNS ONLINEPEERS - README

To run cjdns-onlinepeers, ensure:

	* Either curl or wget is installed and available
	* A compatible js interpreter (SpiderMonkey is known to work) availalble in $PATH (eg: /usr/bin/js)
	* The variables at the top of the script are set correctly
	* That cjdcmd has been configured to access the admin server by setting up ~/.cjdnsadmin

A typcical ~/.cjdnsadmin file uses the values from your config and looks something like:
{
    "addr": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 11234,
    "password": "yourpassword"
}

The recommended js interpreter for the following operating systems can be obtained as follows:
	* Archlinux: pacman -Sy js
	* Debian: apt-get install spidermonkey-bin
	* Ubuntu: apt-get install nodejs

You may then simply run 'sh cjdns-onlinepeers' to list the pubkey + ipv6 of the peers in your config and their online status
